    <h2 style="color: rgb(48, 18, 158);;"><b>CSR Contribution</b></h2>
    <p><b>Indian law now requires companies to give 2% of their profits to charity. After all, a bone to the dog is not
      charity.
      Charity is the bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog. So, a corporate can donate either
      with a bitter feeling
      that they are being forced or with open arms, as an opportunity to make a difference. Dream Girl Foundation has
      made charity easier than ever.
      A corporate can partner with Dream Girl Foundation and in turn help needy children by using one (or more) of the
      following partnerships</b></p>

          <h2> <b>Partnership for Non-Formal Education centers</b> </h2>
          <p>World’s literacy rate at 86% (with some countries with 100%) dwarfs India’s literacy at a meager 74%.
            Poor literacy is one of the biggest factors thwarting the growth of India. We believe that an investment
            in
            knowledge pays the biggest interest.
            So, Dream Girl Foundation sets up Non-formal education centers in backward areas where children don’t have
            access or don’t attend schools.
            Dream Girl Foundation provides free of cost state of the art education to children who can’t afford
            schools.
            Our philosophy is Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. Don’t feel like you are too
            small to
            make.a change anymore and enroll with our NFE Partnership program because in learning one teaches and in
            teaching one learns. Cost of operating one NFE center is 9 lakh Rupees. A corporate can sponsor one or
            more NFE
            centers. It is up to the corporate to sponsor NFEs in nearby areas or far away areas.
            Details of all the children helped by the sponsored NFE center(s) will be shared with the corporate.</p>

            <h2> Partnership for Health Projects:</h2>
            <p>
              There is no feeling more appeasing than helping a terminally ill child. Knowing that your donation saved a
              child’s life and then that child grew up to be a doctor who saves others’ life is truly joyous and
              tranquilizing. You can get the same feeling as thousands of our donors’, by enrolling to our partnership
              for
              health projects. Dream Girl Foundation firmly believes that the secret of the care of the patient is in
              caring
              for the patient. Dream Girl Foundation has so far helped hundreds of children with cancer, tumor and other
              lethal medical conditions. We don’t only provide financial support, but also give moral support to the
              family of
              patient. We believe that we only have what we give. Corporates can enroll to this partnership in one (or
              more)
              of the following 3 ways: <br>

              1. Establishing fund: A corporate can establish fund and as many people as the fund allows will be
              treated.
              Details and genuine discharge summary of all the patients will be given to corporate on annual basis.
              <br> 2. Area-wise treatment: Corporate can choose to fund just the patients of a particular region.
             <br> 3. Disease wise treatment: Corporate can choose to fund patients of just a set of diseases. Corporate can
              choose
              the disease whose patients’ treatment will be funded.

            <p>

              A lot of times in life people think that only way to help destitute is funding money. But one thing the
              people
              forget is that a thing useless to one person can be a gift to another. You will be amazed to know how dear
              your
              “useless” things can be to poor children. So, corporate can inform its employees that donation boxes will
              be in
              the oce for some time and that they can donate anything that they feel is useless. Employees can donate
              stationary, toys, clothes, medicines etc. For poor children nothing is useless, in fact they will see your
              donation as a blessing.

            <p>
              This type of donation is very interesting. In this type employees are encouraged to donate. And the
              corporate
              doubles the total amount collected from donation of all employees. This acts as an incentive for employees
              to
              donate as much as possible because for every penny the employee donates, the needy children get 2 pennies

              weekends. Employees with technical skills can help us technically. Graphic designer can help us make an
              appealing poster that attracts donation.
               Web Developer can help us make a good web site that is easy to
              use and
              helpful for the person who is using it. <br> We believe that no one can do everything, but everyone can do
              something. 
              So, everyone has a way to help us and in turn help impoverished children

            <p>


              1. Good Samaritan: Apart from doing a noble deed of helping children, your corporate will also act as a
              Good
              Samaritan by donating 2% of its profit and not breaking the law.
<br>
              2. Social Media Marketing: We will make sure to promulgate your good name through our Facebook and Twitter
              page.
              It is our job to make mass aware that somewhere there is a corporate that apart from making prot, is also
              going
              to great extent to help poor children.
<br>
              3. Tax Exemption: According to Section-80G of Income-Tax Act, the amount donated towards charity attracts
              benets in form of deduction in taxes. This is a value-added benefit that makes the case for donating even
              stronger.
